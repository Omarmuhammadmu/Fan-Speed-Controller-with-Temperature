# Fan-Speed-Controller-with-Temperature

The aim of this project is to design a temperature-controlled fan using ATmega32 microcontroller, in which the fan is automatically turned ON or OFF according to the temperature.
- Drivers used to build the project: GPIO, ADC, PWM, LM35 Sensor, LCD and DC-Motor
- The used Microcontrollers in the project: ATmega32.
- The project is designed and implemented based on the layered architecture.
- The architecture layer of the system:
